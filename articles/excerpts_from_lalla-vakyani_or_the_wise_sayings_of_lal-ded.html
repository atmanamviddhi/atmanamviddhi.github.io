    <h1>Excerpts from Lalla-Vakyani or The Wise Sayings of Lal-Ded</h1>
<h2>Lalla-Vakyani or The Wise Sayings of Lal-Ded by Lal-Ded (Translated by Sir George Grierson)</h2><p>With passionate longing did I, Lallā, go forth.<br>Seeking and searching did I pass the day and night.<br>Then, lo, saw I in mine own house a learned man,<br>And that was my lucky star and my lucky<br>moment when I laid hold of him.</p>
<p><em>verse: 3</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Slowly, slowly, did I stop my breath in the bellows-pipe (of my throat).<br>Thereby did the lamp (of knowledge) blaze up within me, and then was my true nature revealed unto me.<br>I winnowed forth abroad my inner light,<br>So that, in the darkness itself, I could seize (the truth) and hold it tight.</p>
<p><em>verse: 4</em></p>
<hr>
<p>He who hath deemed another and himself as the same,<br>He who hath deemed the day (of joy) and the night (of sorrow) to be alike,<br>He whose mind hath become free from duality,<br>He, and he alone, hath seen the Lord of the Chiefest of gods.</p>
<p><em>verse: 5</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When cold hath obtained the mastery overwater, the water becometh ice;<br>Or, again, it may be turned to snow.<br>Thus there are three different things; but, on reflection, we see that they are not different.<br>When the sun of the Supreme Consciousness shineth forth, the three will become the same.<br>Lo! By it all things, whether with life or with-<br>out it, the universe itself, are seen as only Śiva.</p>
<p><em>verse: 16</em></p>
<hr>
<p>They came and came, and then they have to go.<br>Ever must they, night and day, move on and on.<br>Whence they came, thither must they go.<br>What is anything? It is nothing, nothing,<br>nothing.</p>
<p><em>verse: 19</em></p>
<hr>
<p>By (controlling) my vital airs I cut my way<br>through the six forests, till the digit of the moon awoke for me, and the material world dried up within me.<br>With the fire of love I parched my heart as a<br>man parcheth grain,<br>And at that moment did I obtain Śiva.</p>
<p><em>verse: 25</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The foulness of my mind fled from me as<br>foulness from a mirror,<br>And then among the people did I gain repute (as a devotee).<br>When I beheld Him, that He was near me,<br>I saw that all was He, and that I am nothing.</p>
<p><em>verse: 31</em></p>
<hr>
<p>He who hath recognized the Brahma-randhra as the shrine of the Self-God,<br>He who hath known the Unobstructed Sound borne upon the breath (that riseth from the heart) unto the nose,<br>His vain imaginings of themselves have fled far away,<br>And he himself (recognizeth) himself as the God. To whom else, therefore, should, he offer worship?</p>
<p><em>verse: 33</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Whate'er work I did, that was worship.<br>Whate'er I uttered with my tongue, that was<br>a mystic formula.<br>This recognition, and this alone, became one with my body,<br>That this alone is the essence of the scriptures of the Supreme Śiva.</p>
<p><em>verse: 58</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There is no 'Thou', no 'I', no object of contemplation, not even contemplation.<br>It is only the All-Creator, who Himself became lost in forgetfulness.<br>The blind folk saw not any meaning in this,<br>But when they saw the Supreme, the seven<br>worlds became lost in nothingness.</p>
<p><em>verse: 59</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I searched for myself, and wearied myself in vain,<br>For no one hath, I ween, e'er by such efforts<br>reached the hidden knowledge.<br>Then absorbed I myself in It, and straightway reached the abode of nectar,<br>Where there are many filled jars, but no one<br>drinketh from them.</p>
<p><em>verse: 60</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I, Lalla, passed in through the door of the<br>jasmine-garden of my soul.<br>And there, Joy! saw I Śiva seated united with His Śakti.<br>There became I absorbed in the lake ofnectar.<br>Now, what can (existence) do unto me? For,<br>even though alive, I shall in it be dead.</p>
<p><em>verse: 68</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Ah restless mind! have no fear within the heart.<br>The Beginningless One Himself taketh though for thee,<br>(And considereth) how hunger may fall from thee.<br>Utter, therefore, to Him alone the cry of salvation.</p>
<p><em>verse: 72</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I, Lalla, went forth in the hope of (blooming like) a cotton-flower.<br>Many a kick did the cleaner and the carder give me.<br>Gossamer made from me did the spinning<br>woman lift from the wheel,<br>And a hanging kick did I receive in the<br>weaver's work-room.</p>
<p><em>verse: 102</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When the washerman dashed me (or turned me over) on the washing-stone,<br>He rubbed me much with fuller's earth and soap.<br>When the tailor worked his scissors on me,<br>piece by piece,<br>Then did I, Lallā, obtain the way of the Supreme.</p>
<p><em>verse: 103</em></p>
