<p>With passionate longing did I, LallƒÅ, go forth.<br>Seeking and searching did I pass the day and night.<br>Then, lo, saw I in mine own house a learned man,<br>And that was my lucky star and my lucky<br>moment when I laid hold of him.</p>
<em>verse: 3  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Slowly, slowly, did I stop my breath in the bellows-pipe (of my throat).<br>Thereby did the lamp (of knowledge) blaze up within me, and then was my true nature revealed unto me.<br>I winnowed forth abroad my inner light,<br>So that, in the darkness itself, I could seize (the truth) and hold it tight.</p>
<em>verse: 4  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>He who hath deemed another and himself as the same,<br>He who hath deemed the day (of joy) and the night (of sorrow) to be alike,<br>He whose mind hath become free from duality,<br>He, and he alone, hath seen the Lord of the Chiefest of gods.</p>

<p>When cold hath obtained the mastery overwater, the water becometh ice;<br>Or, again, it may be turned to snow.<br>Thus there are three different things; but, on reflection, we see that they are not different.<br>When the sun of the Supreme Consciousness shineth forth, the three will become the same.<br>Lo! By it all things, whether with life or with-<br>out it, the universe itself, are seen as only ≈öiva.</p>

<p>By (controlling) my vital airs I cut my way<br>through the six forests, till the digit of the moon awoke for me, and the material world dried up within me.<br>With the fire of love I parched my heart as a<br>man parcheth grain,<br>And at that moment did I obtain ≈öiva.</p>

<p>The foulness of my mind fled from me as<br>foulness from a mirror,<br>And then among the people did I gain repute (as a devotee).<br>When I beheld Him, that He was near me,<br>I saw that all was He, and that I am nothing.</p>

<div class="card">
<p>He who hath recognized the Brahma-randhra as the shrine of the Self-God,<br>He who hath known the Unobstructed Sound borne upon the breath (that riseth from the heart) unto the nose,<br>His vain imaginings of themselves have fled far away,<br>And he himself (recognizeth) himself as the God. To whom else, therefore, should, he offer worship?</p>
<em>verse: 33  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Whate'er work I did, that was worship.<br>Whate'er I uttered with my tongue, that was<br>a mystic formula.<br>This recognition, and this alone, became one with my body,<br>That this alone is the essence of the scriptures of the Supreme ≈öiva.</p>

<p>I searched for myself, and wearied myself in vain,<br>For no one hath, I ween, e'er by such efforts<br>reached the hidden knowledge.<br>Then absorbed I myself in It, and straightway reached the abode of nectar,<br>Where there are many filled jars, but no one<br>drinketh from them.</p>
