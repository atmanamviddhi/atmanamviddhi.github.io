<p>The wise say that the best thing for a man to do in this world is to give up, without the  least longing, Vasanas, (all affinities for objects) which cause the mind to fluctuate, and that such abdication constitutes the Eternal Moksha (salvation) and the stainless path.</p>

<p>If the four sentinels that wait at the gates of Mokṣa (liberation) viz., Śānti (peace or quiescence of mind), Vicāra (Ātmic enquiry), Saṃtoṣa (contentment of mind) and Sādhu-Saṅga (association with the wise) be befriended, then will there be any obstacle to the attainment of liberation? (No).</p>

<p>At the end of a Kalpa, when all the visible universes are annihilated like a dream in Suṣupti, there remains the incomparable Tattva-jñāna existing by itself alone, devoid of the fluctuations of thought, form, name and others and without the transcendent vast darkness of Ajñāna and the light of Vṛtti ((There are two kinds of wisdom, Vṛtti Jñāna and Svarūpa Jñāna. The former pertains to Manas, the reasoning mind, and the latter, to intuition or Buddhi.)) or mental Jñāna. This Supreme Principle is termed by the wise, for the purpose of understanding it, Satya (Truth), Brahman, Ātma, Param (the Supreme) and such like; and manifesting itself as another in a mysterious manner, shines with the title of Jīva; it becomes thereafter, subject to all pains. Then this Ātma which goes now by the name of Jīva and which is the Spirit of the latter, concretes itself through the Saṃkalpa of thought into Manas (mind).</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 1  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>This ever-agitated Manas having come into existence out of the ineffable Brahman creates the world according to its own Saṃkalpa. This legerdemain of the universe springs out of the Saṃkalpa of the Manas (mind). The word ‘ornament’ signifies no other than the gold (or other metal) of which it is composed: therefore it is needless to apply the epithet ‘golden’ to the word ornament. Likewise the word universe means Brahman and none else. The wise apply the many epithets of the painful Moha (delusion), bondage, Tamas, Mala (impurity), Avidyā, Māyā and Saṃsāra to this universe which, though arising out of the unreal mind, appears as real to it, like the waves in a flitting mirage.</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 1  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>The existence in men of the differences of conception of ‘I’ and ‘thou’ is bondage. So long as this Saṃkalpa exists, so long is it difficult for them to attain liberation.</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 1  </em></div>
<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>The individualized mind which is Avidyā-full, formless and all-pervading though existing in name, has no form, either externally or internally, like the Ākāśa permeating everywhere. The mere manifestation in all objects of reality (or non-reality therein) is the mind. Wherever there is the Saṃkalpa, there does the mind exist. The form of the mind is Saṃkalpa alone. Both of them are identical. The multitudinous denominations of unreality, delusion, impurity, bondage, Avidyā, Māyā, Tamas and others are the fit synonyms of Saṃkalpa. With the annihilation of this Saṃkalpa, all conception of the differences between the seer and the seen will vanish and then the Reality of Brahman will begin to shine unintercepted. Then this shadow of all the universe moveable and fixed, will be found absorbed in it in a non-dual state, though, in another sense, they cannot be said to commingle with it. Then Consciousness alone will shine without the reflections of a glass. If all the heterogeneous differences of objects arising through the conception of the mythical ‘I’ and ‘Thou’ are controlled and even a scintilla of the visible things be completely destroyed beyond resurrection, then such a destruction is itself the certitude of Kaivalya (or Liberation).</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 1  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Being the immaculate Jñāna, It (Atma) is the all-pervading Ākāśa itself. Whatever objects It contemplates upon, those objects come into existence (at once). In that Jñāna, all the three worlds will arise and be destroyed, like water in a mirage. Having evolved all objects, It will yet be in its true state unaffected, as if disconnected with them. The origin and absorption of the universe do not take place from and into Nirvikalpa Ātma direct. If one should hold communion with that Supreme Principle, devoid of mental fancies and modifications, then the great bondage of the mind will cease, all doubts will vanish, and all Karmas will perish.</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 1  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>During the period of Māhakalpa, the cause of all (imaginable) causes, viz., the Brahmic Reality shines alone. If the modifications of the mind which lean to sensual pleasures be destroyed, then Ātma divested of its Ahaṃkāra (egoism) becomes the unnamable Brahmic (or the all-pervading) Reality. The Jīvic consciousness which does not regard (as real) the universe before it, may truly be stated to be Brahman itself. A mind which, though enjoying the diverse objects, does not yet enjoy them may be stated to be Brahman itself. That consciousness which is a witness to all thoughts of objects, the light of the Sun? etc., mind and the other visible things may be said to be Brahman itself. </p>

<p>Thereupon Saraśvatī said thus “Of the three kinds of Ākāśa, viz., Chit-Ākāśa, (Chidākāśa or Spiritual Ākāśa), Chitta-Ākāśa, (or mental Ākāśa) and Bhūta-Ākāśa (or elemental Ākāśa), Cidākāśa is that intermediate state in which the mind is, when it flits from one object to another in the elemental Ākāśa of objects. When the hosts of Saṃkalpas (in us) perish, then it is that the light of Chit will shine in us which is quiescent and immaculate and manifests itself as the universe. If one becomes convinced of the unreality of the visible objects, then, through that Jñāna, he will attain at once Cidākāśa. Mayest thou attain through my grace that Cidākāśa.”</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 2  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Know also all the universes, arising through the egoism of “I” and “mine,” etc, to be nothing but a dream and the different objects seen therein to be as illusory as things in a dream. Such objects and universes are no other than of the nature of that Jñāna (Reality) which is all permanent Param-Ākāśa, actionless, full, vast and immaculate. It is the one reality which, being all and having all with the different Śaktis (potencies), manifests itself, without being diminished thereby, in different forms according to the fructification of time and Karmas.</p>

<p>To which the goddess replied thus “I never give anything (without any cause) to any person. People get all things according to (or as the result of) their thoughts. You thought of (acquiring) Jñāna before and implored me for it and I gave you therefore the Divine Vision longed for by you. This damsel, your shadow, prompted by excessive desire asked of me another boon which was, as promptly, granted. All men through my grace get what ever their minds long after.”</p>

<p>The mastery of Brahman can be effected through the mind alone after abandoning its Saṃkalpas and Vikalpas. The origin and dissolution of this universe (which is nothing but a mode of consciousness), take place with the complete origination and destruction of the Saṃkalpas of the mind. Such a process is the real state (or import) of the holy sentences in the Vedas; but yet it is exterior to them, as it is through self-experience alone that such a process can be developed. It occupies a state intermediate between Sat (being) and Asat (non-being) and is the real state of the two. It is this Saṃkalpa of the mind that brings into play this world with all its moving and fixed creatures.</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 3  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Vasiṣṭha continued: "This personage is no other than the Divine Māyā, sent here to illustrate clearly the fact that this universe is no other than the mind itself. Know also, Oh valiant Prince, the wise say that the self-light of Parabrahm alone is, appearing as mind or this universe."</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 8  </em></div>
<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>Muni Vasiṣṭha continued: “The poisonous tree of the great Māyā’s illusion flourishes more and more, out of the seed of the mind’s modifications full of Saṃkalpa, in the soil of the variegated enjoyments of the world. The panacea prescribed by the wise for the removal of the diseases of the mind can be got at very easily through the mind alone.</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 9  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>This fluctuating power of the mind is dubbed with several names such as Māyā, the impure Vāsanās and others. The flitting mind is no other than the fluctuating Śakti itself. It is this fluctuating potency of the mind that you should destroy through ceaseless Ātma-jñāna enquiry.</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 9  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>The mind which occupies an intermediate state between Brahman that ever is and the universe that is not, ever oscillates gravitating towards the one or the other. This mind becomes of the nature of Jñāna through dint of the efforts towards spiritual direction; but becomes of the nature of the universe through Ajñāna. Through its own efforts, the mind assumes the shape of any object it concentrates itself upon. Therefore you should, through your Ātma-jñāna mind, avoid the mind which runs in the direction of objects; and progressing higher up, should, without any despondency of heart, accumulate wealth for that imperishable Supreme state.</p>

<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>The non-cognition of oneself as Brahman which is the Laya (neutral) centre of all, is itself the bondage of the mind; but the firm cognition of oneself as Brahman is itself Mokṣa.</p>
<em>section: 3  </em><em>chapter: 9  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>It is the mind alone that (in esse) is Ātma and none else. The mind’s acts (and not the bodily ones) are alone the true acts. Through its life in this world, it is called Jīva. It is called Buddhi, through its certainty of knowledge. It is called the dire Ahaṃkāra when the conceptions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ assert themselves with the signs of anger, etc. And it is this mind alone, that is the universe through the conception of excessive differentiations.</p>
<em>section: 4  </em><em>chapter: 1  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Those only are the cognizers of Tattva (or Reality) who do perceive objectively, through their non-fluctuating Jñāna-Vision, that all the countless universes and egos of men are none else but the light of the imperishable Jñāna. Those only are the cognizers of Tattva who perceive objectively that it is the immeasurable Ātma Jñāna alone which manifests itself as all potencies and yet is non-dual (in its innate condition) and which is the latency of all possible ideations. Those only are the cognizers of Tattva who perceive objectively that Brahman alone is, as being the laya centre between being and non-being and that in it there is nothing, as apart from It, such as the knower of ‘I’ or the known of the universe.</p>
<em>section: 4  </em><em>chapter: 2  </em></div>
<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>At these words of Dāśūra, his disciple asked him thus: ‘What is Saṃkalpa? How came it into existence? And how does it flourish and go out of existence, decreasing gradually?’ To which the Muni replied thus: ‘The mere manifestation, as the visible things, of Ātma-jñāna the supreme, the true and the universal is Saṃkalpa. Rising from a small beginning, this Saṃkalpa is the primeval seed. Gradually and regularly increasing, it begins to obscure the one clear Paramātma, like the thick clouds, in order to generate firmly the conception of inertness. Oh my son, when the intelligence views the visible things outside, then it differentiates them from itself. Then Saṃkalpa reigns supreme. The seed of Jñāna is no other than the sprout of Saṃkalpa. This Saṃkalpa, having considered itself as different from others, will generate itself as well as increase prodigiously. Such a procedure is for its evil only and is in no way beneficial to it. Therefore do not dream of walking in the path of Saṃkalpa. Do not for a moment contemplate upon the things of the universe. Through such a contemplation, there will ensue to you supreme happiness. You need not exert yourself too much to rid yourself of this Saṃkalpa. With the checking of all thoughts, one’s mind will perish. To crumple a full-blown flower in one’s hand, taxes a little effort, but even that little effort is not needed to do away with Saṃkalpa. Saṃkalpa is destroyed with the control of thoughts. Having firmly annihilated the external Saṃkalpa through the internal one, and having destroyed the impure mind through the pure one, may you rest firmly in your Ātma-jñāna.</p>
<em>section: 4  </em><em>chapter: 4  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Having tasted all things through experience and inference, do not grieve for them. Do not think of the past or of the future; but remain in that non-dual state with the transcendent Sattva-guṇa and without the dualities of desire and hatred and others. With an equal eye to all, with the certitude of conviction in Ātma-jñāna and a powerful Jñāna, and with extreme quiescence and a mind silent to all worldly objects, may you, Oh Rāma, relinquish all pains with a mind as transparent as crystal.</p>
<em>section: 5  </em><em>chapter: 1  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>A mind, devoid of pains, which has developed an equal vision over all, through quiescence, will attain the state of its Ātmic Reality which is the plenum of complete bliss. This is Mokṣa.’ So said many Siddhas.</p>

<p>How came this Māyā to play and dance in this world? This ghost of my mind dances in the theatre of this universe to the music of the organs.</p>

<div class="card">
<p>The mind of delusion constitutes the root of the tree of Saṃsāra of Ajñāna which ramifies in all directions with branches full of flowers, tendrils, fruits, etc. It is this mind which is called Saṃkalpa. With the destruction of Saṃkalpa, the mind will be also destroyed easily. The baneful root of mind being destroyed, the tree of birth and death will also be destroyed. Oh, I have detected the thief who robbed me of my Ātmic Jewel, viz., my Self. His name is Manas (Mind). I have been long suffering through this villain. I will now hang him and make him die.</p>

<div class="card">
<p>Thus did king Janaka remain statue-like in Samādhi, after having destroyed all fluctuation of mind. After being in it for a long time, he returned from it and then surveyed the universe through his quiescent mind, his impure one having been destroyed past resurrection, with the following remarks: ‘What object is there in this world for me to encompass? What is illusory? To my present scrutinizing eye, all is pure Jñāna only. I cognize nothing but the one immaculate Ātma-jñāna my own Reality. I will never long for any object, I do not come across; nor will I evince any aversion towards any object that I do not come by. I will remain immutably fixed in my own Self of Ātma-jñāna. Things will happen as pre-ordained.’ So saying the king was absorbed with Brahmic bliss in the non-dual state.</p>
<em>section: 5  </em><em>chapter: 1  </em></div>
<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>If with every day the base conception of the differentiation of ‘he’, ‘I’, etc., be gradually destroyed, then the expansive Jñāna which is all this universe will arise stainlessly. With true discrimination arising more and more in the mind, it will be able to cognize its own Ātma-jñāna.</p>
<em>section: 5  </em><em>chapter: 2  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>When attraction and repulsion (towards objects) become of the nature of the mind (and commingle with it), it alone is bondage and nothing else. Having avoided all desires and pains arising through the ripened love and hatred towards objects, may you be immovable, devoid of attraction or repulsion towards them.</p>
<em>section: 5  </em><em>chapter: 2  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Vasiṣṭha thereupon replied “Men versed in the sacred lore state that there are two paths by which the Ahaṃkāric Vāsanās can be destroyed. Instead of thinking with certainty as we do now we live for objects or the objects live for us; or in the absence of these invaluable objects, the ‘I’ does not exist or these objects do not exist in the absence of ‘I’, one should, through pure enquiry, differentiate himself (as separate) from the objects, with the idea the ‘I’ does not belong to the objects or the objects do not belong to the ‘I’; and his mind should give up all Vāsanās with no faltering certitude and should perform all things, as if in sport. This is what is called jñeya-Tyāga (or the renunciation of the known), Oh Rāma showering grace like clouds. Then having destroyed the Vāsanās and looking with an equal vision over all, if one should abandon this burden of the body, then such an extinction of Vāsanās constitutes the stainless jñeya-tyāga (or the renunciation of the known). Those only are the wise who have given up all the Vāsanās which have concreted themselves into the tangible shape of the body of Ahaṃkāra.</p>
<em>section: 5  </em><em>chapter: 2  </em></div>
<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>This universe which has arisen in the form of wife and other relatives, foes and kindred love and hatred, nobleness and lowness as well as other pairs, exists and expands by virtue of its name (and form) only and none else. Think of one as a good friend of yours and there the thing is created as a reality. Think of him as your foe and then also the mind perfects the thought into an actuality. Like the properties of the murderous poison or the rejuvenating nectar which accomplish their desired ends, so also if once the bondage-giving thoughts are completely destroyed by one, then they will never resurrect from their grave. How can we attribute enmity or friendship to the intelligence in diverse forms arising from the one Ātma? If we begin to enquire, as to who are in the tabernacle (of body) which is nothing but a network of bones filled with flesh, blood and skin and which, though non-existent, deludes us with its existence as real, then what remains is this ‘I’. Then contemplating still further with the mind, we find through the stainless Brahmic Vision gradually developed, that neither you nor I nor Puṇya nor Pāvana nor anyone else exists, but the one Jñāna which then shines alone.</p>

<p>Free yourself from their trammels, make the lotus of your heart as pure as possible and cognise through your (higher) mind your own Reality. Then all illusions will vanish completely and you, my brother, will attain Nirvāṇic Bliss.” So said Vasiṣṭha to Śrī Rāma.</p>
<em>section: 5  </em><em>chapter: 2  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>All the manifestations here before us are Jñāna only; all that are now external to us (or above our present perception) are Jñāna only; that which is conditioned is Jñāna; that which is not conditioned is Jñāna also; I that speak am Jñāna; you that hear are Jñāna only; and all the universe is nothing but the all-full Jñāna only. This in brief is the Truth. Being impressed with this firm conclusion in your mind, may you meditate upon the one Reality of Jñāna with the intelligence that is requisite for it. If without any modifications of the mind, you cognize and perceive it, then you will attain your goal of the supreme state.</p>

<p>However unlimited were the armies of good and bad thoughts that cropped up unceasingly in his mind, however countless were the objects, imaginary and real that manifested themselves before him, yet he was able to control them all in one centre. So also, shall you, Oh Rāma, pinion your mind, roving amidst the pleasures of this world and the higher, in the centre of your heart. In whatever places your mind totters like a child and sinks into sensual objects, from that place shall the mind have to be lifted up to the partless Jñāna and be made to attain it. Having reduced this to a regular practice, may you bind this terrible elephant of mind so as to be untrammelled by pains and enable it to reach Mokṣa through discrimination.</p>

<p>Therefore my spiritual vision of quiescent Jñāna which is eternal, blissful and in comparable is in all the worlds. All the manifested appearances are only the spiritual vision of the one subtle ideation. As all Jīvas are no other than “I”, the invisible Jñāna and Pratyagātman that has no other object than itself to lean upon, I offer salutations to them all on account of (their non-divisibility from) my own Self.</p>

<p>Viṣṇu replied thus: ‘Oh Brahmin, this earth and other things of the universe, have for their substratum the mind and do not exist at any period apart from the mind. Almost all persons in this world, walking in the path of this universe of dreams, delusion and egoism look upon it as real and enjoy it. It is only in Chitta (the flitting mind) that the universe rests. Why shouldst thou be surprised, if this mind of thine, which contains (potentially) in itself all the Universe, should bring into objectivity thy life of a Nīca (which is but an insignificant part of the whole). The excessive one-pointedness (or ideation) of thy mind reflected itself in the life of a Nīca which reflection was then known. This reflection was caught up by the guest who came in subse quently and saw as real all these delusions.</p>

<p>Oh, Rāma, the wise will perform duly all actions arising, out of their castes and orders of life, every moment of their lives during their present period, but will never concern themselves with actions, past or future. If every moment of your life you try to abandon all Saṃkalpas, desires and past actions, then this itself is called the absorption of the mind. That Jñāna which is associated with the destruction of the mind is the Jñāna of the partless Pratyagātman. Such a Jñāna is without the mental modifications and being, It is without the Vikalpa of the mind.</p>

<p>Vasiṣṭha replied: The fluctuation of the mind is associated with the mind itself (or is an attribute of it), like oil in sesame seed or whiteness in snow. There are two paths to destroy this fluctuation, namely Yoga and Jñāna. Yoga is that which makes the actions of the mind integrated (or makes the mind concentrate itself upon one object only). But Jñāna is that which enables one to enjoy happiness in all (objects). Persons who have as their ornament the supreme Vedas hold that the mind is nothing but the fluctuation of Prāṇa. With the control of Prāṇa, the mind is also controlled. With the control of the mind’s fluctuation, rebirth will cease, like the daily actions that cease to be per­formed at sunset.</p>

<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>The firm conviction that Brahman alone is the self-shining one everywhere, without beginning, middle or end is true Jñāna. The certitude that the potencies (Saktis) of all the differentiated illusory objects are no other than Atman is the worship of Atman. The clear cognition that all worlds are only the form of Parabrahman which is the only true Principle in the three worlds is Piirna (the Plenum). All worlds are of the nature of Atman alone.</p>

I meditate ceaselessly upon that Cidātma who is in the Ākāśa directly in front of the end of my nose, when Prāṇa and Apāna become both extinct. Thus I attained the Supreme state worshipped by Devas through my faultless vision and surrounded by rays. Thus it is, through this path of Prāṇa’s control, that I attained the Supreme and immaculate Tattva devoid of pains.</p>
