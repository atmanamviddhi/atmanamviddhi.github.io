<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>The Tantrāloka says that the union of Śiva and Śakti is called saṁghaṭṭa and is the power of bliss (ānanda) from which everything is engendered. The lotus flower at the top of the brain is the seat of Parama Śiva-Śakti, which is the state of pure consciousness.</p>
<em>verse: 2  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>The perfect form is unmanifest, though the nature of Śiva is bliss and consciousness. The body of bliss corresponds to creation, the unmanifest form to reabsorption. The supreme principle, Śiva, transcends every determination of time and space and is absolutely independent of the objective world, He is the pure self transcending everything and at the same time immanent, in that everything is the real reflection of His consciousness. The second principle, comprised in the first, is Śakti, the Power, and is characterized by the I who affirms himself as an active force, and it is at the same time a partial obfuscation of the absoluteness of the I, that unfolds in the thirty-six principles that constitute the external world and the body, and thus Śiva is therefore both pure I and yet unfolds in the thirty-six principles that constitute everything.</p>

<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>Āṇava mala is the subtle maculation, or innate ignorance, that reduces the universal consciousness to the rank of empirical experiencer who does not recognize his own nature as identical to it; it is the cause of ignorance and causes the birth of transmigration. Māyīya mala is the maculation due to māyā, the power of illusion, that gives the soul its gross and subtle body and the reason why the individual soul perceives diversity everywhere. Kārmika mala is the maculation due to the karman, because of which the individual acts driven by his own personal desires to achieve his own personal ends. Because of these three maculations the individual is devoid of energy, he is, as Kṣemarāja says, śaktidaridra, that is he has lost the perfect powers of action and knowledge and is subject to transmigration: the universal Consciousness (Cit) has assumed the aspect of jīva, the limited soul. </p>

<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>Abhinavagupta says that this wheel of Śiva, surrounded by the powers, must always be meditated on, even when everything is dissolved, as the great, rotating, real expression of the superabundance of one's own self. Once knowledge has been purified through the bathing, that consists in immersion in the self recognized as identical to everything, that is none other than Śiva, God is thus worshipped.</p>
<em>verse: 7  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>With [my] eyes to the sun and the moon (or "that are the sun and the moon”), churning (manth) the ocean of Power (Sakti), I offer to Śiva an unguent made with the juice (rasa) of the supreme ambrosia (parāmṛta).</p>
<em>verse: 14  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>In yoga the states of the mind are divided into five groups. The first is the kṣipta state, in which the mental energies are in disorder, scattered, in a state of neglect. Here rajas predominates. The second state is vikṣipta, in which the mind is agitated and distracted. The third is mūdha, and it denotes a mind that is obtuse, slow and confused; here tamas predominates. In the fourth state the mind is ekāgra, namely attentive and concentrated, ditrected towards a single goal; here sattva prevails.<br>Once this point is reached, however, one risks becoming egoistic, if one aims at achieving a personal goal. Only bhakti can lead the mind to the right aim. Concentration however, sustained and guided by ardent faith, is directed towards God: the state of niruddha is reached, in which manas (mind), buddhi (intellect) and ahamkāra (sense of the I) are under control and come to be completely reabsorbed in Him. Then the sense of I and you disappears, one attains the sole reality that is Śiva.</p>
