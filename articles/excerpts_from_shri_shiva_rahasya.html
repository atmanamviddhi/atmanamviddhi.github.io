<p>I, the One Lord, through My Play of Darkness and Light bring forth everything in sight. All created things are but sparks of My Divine Light. A part of Me, of My Infinite Self, lies hidden in all things.</p>
<em>chapter: 1  </em><em>verse: 42  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>Having created a thought, through repetition man identifies therewith and believes himself to be that, regardless of his true nature. O Sages of broad understanding! Man is called Man (Manu) because he is determined by his Mind (Manas). Verily, what Man thinks, that he becomes. Under the influence of material existence, the Self who is by birth a God, thinks himself to be a Man, and a Man he at last becomes.</p>
<em>chapter: 1  </em><em>verse: 55  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>As the Sky does not become soiled through contact with clouds and the Sun is ever untouched by darkness, even so the various activities of the mind such as thoughts, feelings or sense perceptions, do not affect the Perfect Self. Only the mind and the body, being by nature imperfect, are affected thereby.</p>

<p>Wise men regard this Universe as being made of knowledge. For it arises from the waves of thought dancing upon the surface of the Ocean of Universal Consciousness. That Great Intelligence Which is Boundless and Radiant Beyond Measure, fashions thought from Its rays of light. Thought gives rise to perceptions; and perceptions make up the objects of the World.</p>
<em>chapter: 1  </em><em>verse: 71  </em></div>

<p>I Myself am that Great Lord (Maheshvara), Whose Lordship is attainable through Yoga. I am the Unseen Master of the Cosmic Magic (Maya), the Greatest God. I am glorified in the true Scriptures as the Self of all and having faces in all directions. I am the Perfect One Who See all things from Above, the Witness of all that passes.</p>

<p>That which is known as Matter or Material Energy (Prakarti) gives birth to the Material Universe (Jagat) beginning with the Intellect and ending with the particularised forms.  The Life-Principle called Soul (Atma) enjoys the attributes of Matter as he interacts with it, and falls under its spell.</p>

<p>As the Wind as it rushes over the Sea stirs the water into waves, so the Will of the Self rushing over the tranquil Sea of Matter stirs its waters into life.  Waves of thought, feeling and perception arise therefrom and from that, the World is born. What was unseen comes to sight and what was unmade is brought to pass: thus the unborn springs to life.</p>
<em>chapter: 2  </em><em>verse: 17  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>But the Yogi who is a Knower of the Self, knows that his Self alone endures and that Matter, from which all things in this World arise, is but his own material half: dividing Itself twofold, the Self becomes on one side the observer and on the other that which is observed.</p>

<em>chapter: 5  </em><em>verse: 16  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>From the will to live, Knowledge and Action are born. Verily, both Knowledge and Action are born of desire. Desire is the activity of the Mind. And the Mind is that aspect of the Soul which desires. For, when the Soul rests in himself, he is happy, peaceful and still. But when he desires a thing he rests not till he has obtained the object of his will.</p>

<p>Having performed an action with a view to obtaining some object or another, one is bound to the result of one's action according to the Inexorable Law of Cause and Effect (Karma). But that Action which springs from Knowledge (and not ignorance), which is selfless and is aimed at Me, the Highest Goal, leads to Liberation and not to bondage.</p>

<p>I Alone Am the Eternal Supreme God. I Am at once Matter and Spirit and their products such as the Intellect and the rest, too.

<p>He who abides under Maya's Spell is a bound Soul. He who rises above Maya is its master. Therefore, Maya is the fetter to be conquered through Sadhana or Spiritual Discipline. He who knows the Great Secret of Maya, knows how the World comes into being. He knows how, though the Souls appear to be many, they are in reality One.</p>
<em>chapter: 7  </em><em>verse: 16  </em></div>

<p>O Sages! the body knows only itself. The mind knows the body. And the Soul knows body, mind and himself. It is for this reason that the Soul (Atma) has been called Self (Atma). For he is the Self of all three and the true Self of man.</p>

<p>O you who ever see the Truth! the Universe, resting upon Consciousness, is made of Knowledge. Knowledge is of two kinds: Awake and Dormant. When awake, it is called Knower.
