    <h1>Excerpts from Changadev Pasashti</h1>
<h2>Changadev Pasashti (Translated by Swami Abhayananda)</h2><p>When He is revealed, the Universe disappears;<br>When He is concealed, the Universe shines forth.<br>Yet He doesn't hide Himself,<br>Nor does He reveal Himself;<br>He is always present before us at every moment.</p>
<p><em>verse: 2</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It is not ignorance that causes the separation<br>Between the perceiver and the perceived;<br>Truly, everything is Himself,<br>And He is the cause of everything.</p>
<p><em>verse: 8</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It's the one pure Consciousness that becomes everything.<br>From the Gods above to the Earth below.</p>
<p><em>verse: 12</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Though the shadows on the wall are ever changing,<br>The wall itself remains steady and immobile.<br>Likewise, the forms of the Universe take shape.<br>Upon the one eternal and unchanging Consciousness.</p>
<p><em>verse: 13</em></p>
<hr>
<p>From within Its own divine pure depths,<br>It gives birth to the perceivable world.<br>The perceiver, the perceived, and the act of perception:<br>These three form the eternal triad of manifestation.</p>
<p><em>verse: 18</em></p>
