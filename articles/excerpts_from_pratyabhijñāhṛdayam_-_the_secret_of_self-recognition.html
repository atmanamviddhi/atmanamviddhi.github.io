<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>When the highest Lord whose very essence is consciousness, conceals by His free will, pervasion of non-duality, and assumes duality all round, then His will and other powers, though essentially non-limited assume limitation. Then only does this (soul) become a transmigratory being, covered with mala</p>
<em>verse: 9  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>Thus constituted this (ātman or Self) is called saṁsārin (a transmigratory being), poor in Śakti. With the (full) unfoldment of his śaktis, however, he is Śiva himself.</p>
<em>verse: 9  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>When (an aspirant) keeps his citta (individual consciousness) concentrated on the samvid or cit (lit. heart) restraining, by the method alluded to, the vikalpas that obstruct staying in one's real nature, by not thinking of anything whatsoever, and thus by laying hold of avikalpa state, he becomes used to the habit of regarding his cit as the (real) knower, untarnished by body etc., and so within a short time only, he attains absorption into turya and the state transcending turya (turyātita) which are on the point of unfolding.</p>
