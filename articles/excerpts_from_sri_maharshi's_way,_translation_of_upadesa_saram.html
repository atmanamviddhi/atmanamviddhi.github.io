<p>The practice of fixing the mind in its own source in the Heart is, without doubt, true bhakti, yoga, and understanding.</p>
<em>verse: 10  </em></div>

<p>The mind may be subdued by regulating the breath, just as a bird is restrained when caught in a net. This practice controls the mind.</p>
<em>verse: 11  </em></div>
<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>When the mind has been suspended by breath restraint, it may then be annihilated by single-minded attention to the Self.</p>
<em>verse: 14  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>What one has thought of as his mind is merely a bundle of thoughts. All these thoughts depend upon the one thought of “I”, the ego. Therefore, the so-called mind is the “I” thought.</p>
<em>verse: 18  </em></div>
<div class="card">
