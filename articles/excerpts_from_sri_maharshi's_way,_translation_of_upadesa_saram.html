    <h1>Excerpts from Sri Maharshi's Way, translation of Upadesa Saram</h1>
<h2>Sri Maharshi's Way, translation of Upadesa Saram (Translated by D. M. Sastri)</h2><p>That action which is done without personal desire and whose fruits are surrendered to the Lord, purifies the mind and leads to Liberation.</p>
<p><em>verse: 3</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The practice of fixing the mind in its own source in the Heart is, without doubt, true bhakti, yoga, and understanding.</p>
<p><em>verse: 10</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The mind may be subdued by regulating the breath, just as a bird is restrained when caught in a net. This practice controls the mind.</p>
<p><em>verse: 11</em></p>
<hr>
<p>When the mind has been suspended by breath restraint, it may then be annihilated by single-minded attention to the Self.</p>
<p><em>verse: 14</em></p>
<hr>
<p>What one has thought of as his mind is merely a bundle of thoughts. All these thoughts depend upon the one thought of “I”, the ego. Therefore, the so-called mind is the “I” thought.</p>
<p><em>verse: 18</em></p>
<hr>
<p>True knowledge is beyond what we think of as 'knowledge' or 'ignorance' because in the State of Non-differentiation what other thing is to be known</p>
<p><em>verse: 27</em></p>
