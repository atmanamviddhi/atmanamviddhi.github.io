    <h1>Excerpts from Amritānubhava</h1>
<h2>Amritānubhava by Jnaneshvar (Translated by Swami Abhayananda)</h2><p>How sweet is their union!<br>The whole world is too small to contain them,<br>Yet they live happily in the smallest particle.</p>

<p>They regard each other as their own Self,<br>And neither creates so much as a blade of grass without the other.</p>
<p><em>chapter: 1</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 12</em></p>

<p>It is Shiva alone who lives in all forms;<br>He is both the male and the female.<br>It is because of the union of these two complements<br>That the whole Universe exists. </p>
<p><em>chapter: 1</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 17</em></p>
<hr>

<p>Jñānadev says,<br>I honor the primal pair of Shiva and Shakti Who, by swallowing up the sweet dish of name  and form,<br>Reveal their underlying unity.</p>
<p><em>chapter: 1</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 45</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So long as Unity is undisturbed,<br>And a graceful pleasure is thereby derived,<br>Why should not the water find delight<br>In the floral fragrance of its own rippled surface?</p>
<p><em>chapter: 1</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 59</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Although the supreme Reality is one, Differences arise within It;<br>But how does differentiation detract from the unity of the whole?</p>
<p><em>chapter: 2</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 60</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The words, ‘Guru’ and ‘disciple’<br>Refer to but one;<br>The Guru alone exists as both these forms.</p>
<p><em>chapter: 2</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 61</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If the Self, which is pure Knowledge itself, Requires the help of another knowledge,<br>Would that not be like the Sun seeking help<br>Of another light?</p>

<p><em>verse: 19</em></p>

<p><em>chapter: 5</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 52</em></p>
<hr>
<p>How can words describe the supreme Reality<br>Where even the subtlest speech itself disappears,<br>And there is left no trace of sound?</p>
<p><em>chapter: 5</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 63</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Why should there be any talk<br>About waking a person who is already awake? Does one begin to cook his food<br>After he has taken his meal and become satisfied?</p>
<p><em>chapter: 5</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 64</em></p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>There is nothing else besides the one Being. Therefore, It cannot be the object<br>Of remembering or forgetting.</p>

<p><em>verse: 16</em></p>

<p>To one who is awake, there is no sleep;<br>But is there awaking either?<br>In the same way,<br>There can be no remembering or forgetting<br>To the one Being.</p>
<p><em>chapter: 6</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 18</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The Ultimate Reality<br>Does not prove or disprove Itself<br>With the help of some other kind of knowledge; It is self-evident, being the knower,<br>And is beyond proof and disproof.</p>
<p><em>chapter: 6</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 96</em></p>

<p>Innumerable forms and visions arise,<br>But it is one pure Consciousness<br>Which is the substance of all.</p>

<p>Every moment,<br>A particular quality is swallowed up,<br>And its opposite emerges.<br>This is the opening and closing<br>Of the eye of Reality.</p>
<p><em>chapter: 7</em></p>
<p><em>verse: 183</em></p>
