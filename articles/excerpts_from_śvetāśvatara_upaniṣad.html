<em>chapter: 2  </em><em>verse: 14  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>He who protects and controls the worlds by His own powers, He - Rudra - is indeed one only. There is no one beside Him who can make Him the second. O men, He is present inside the hearts of all beings. After projecting and maintaining all the worlds, He finally withdraws them into Himself. </p>
<em>chapter: 3  </em><em>verse: 2  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>There is naught higher than or different from Him; naught greater or more minute than Him. Rooted in His own glory He stands like a tree, one without a second and immovable. By that Being the whole universe is filled.</p>
<em>chapter: 3  </em><em>verse: 9  </em></div>
<div id="ads-container"></div><div class="card">
<p>That which is, that which was, and that which is yet to be - all this is nothing but this Infinite Being. Though He grows beyond His own nature into the form of the objective universe, He still remains the lord of immortality.</p>
<em>chapter: 3  </em><em>verse: 15  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>When ignorance is dispelled, there is neither day nor night, neither being nor non-being. There is only that Auspicious One who is imperishable, and who is worthy of being adored by the creator. From Him has proceeded the ancient wisdom.</p>
<em>chapter: 4  </em><em>verse: 18  </em></div>
<div class="card">
<p>The sun does not shine there ; neither the moon, nor the stars. There these lightnings shine not, - how then this fire? Because He shines, everything shines after Him. By His light all this shines.</p>
