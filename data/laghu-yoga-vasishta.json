Gradually and regularly increasing, it begins to obscure the one clear Paramātma, like the thick clouds, in order to generate firmly the conception of inertness. Oh my son, when the intelligence views the visible things outside, then it differentiates them from itself. Then Saṃkalpa reigns supreme. The seed of Jñāna is no other than the sprout of Saṃkalpa. This Saṃkalpa, having considered itself as different from others, will generate itself as well as increase prodigiously. Such a procedure is for its evil only and is in no way beneficial to it. Therefore do not dream of walking in the path of Saṃkalpa. Do not for a moment contemplate upon the things of the universe. Through such a contemplation, there will ensue to you supreme happiness. You need not exert yourself too much to rid yourself of this Saṃkalpa. With the checking of all thoughts, one’s mind will perish. To crumple a full-blown flower in one’s hand, taxes a little effort, but even that little effort is not needed to do away with Saṃkalpa. Saṃkalpa is destroyed with the control of thoughts.

Almost all persons in this world, walking in the path of this universe of dreams, delusion and egoism look upon it as real and enjoy it. It is only in Chitta (the flitting mind) that the universe rests. Why shouldst thou be surprised, if this mind of thine, which contains (potentially) in itself all the Universe, should bring into objectivity thy life of a Nīca (which is but an insignificant part of the whole). The excessive one-pointedness (or ideation) of thy mind reflected itself in the life of a Nīca which reflection was then known. This reflection was caught up by the guest who came in subse quently and saw as real all these delusions.",

But Jñāna is that which enables one to enjoy happiness in all (objects). Persons who have as their ornament the supreme Vedas hold that the mind is nothing but the fluctuation of Prāṇa.
